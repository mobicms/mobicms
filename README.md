## Installation
**To install the general availability version**, go to the [**project website**](https://mobicms.org) and download the latest available distributive.
Then follow the installation instructions that came with it.

**To install the developer version**, you must have a [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) dependency manager
and [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) version control system.
1. Clone or download this repository on local workstation.
2. Assign the repository folder as Apache virtual host, or move contents to the previously created virtual host folder.
3. Create MySQL Database.
4. Import into the created database ALL files that are located in the `/install/sql` folder.
5. Copy the `/config/autoload/db.local.php.dist` file to `/config/autoload/db.local.php`.
6. Write in the copied file the credentials of access to the database you created.
7. Copy the `/config/autoload/development.local.php.dist` file to `/config/autoload/development.local.php`.
8. Open the console in the virtual host folder and install the dependencies using the command `composer install`.
9. **This is all done**. If you go to the address of your virtual host from the browser, you should see a working site with demo data.
